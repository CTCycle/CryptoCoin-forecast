# CryptoCoin-forecast

## Project description
This is a Python application (with GUI) developed around the concept of cryptocoin price forecasting. As a matter of fact, allows scraping data from the cryptocoin website coingecko.com. It works using the given coingecko API for fast and reliable data collection (prices and volumes history). The extracted timeseries are then used to train a prototype multilayer LSTM model for price forecasting. While the aim of this project is to predict future prices of cryptocoins, the model solely relies on previous price observations, and therefor does not take into acccount real life perturbations and fluctuations due to differetn market factors. In any way it should be used to bet on future cryptocoinds prices, as it is not considered sufficiently reliable (as mostly any other predictive model based on timeseries isn't).
