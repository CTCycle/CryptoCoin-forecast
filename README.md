# CryptoCoin-forecast

## Project description
This is a Python application (with GUI) developed around the concept of cryptocoin price forecasting. As a matter of fact, this app uses the coingecko API to retrieve hisotry of cryptocoins prices. The extracted data is asaved as a csv file, which can be selected to train a Deep Learning (DL) recurrent model in order to forecast future prices and general tendency of the timeseries. While the aim of this project is to predict the crypto assets future price, the DL models are built to rely solely on previous price  observations, meaning that in any way this software takes into acccount real life perturbations and fluctuations due to differetn market factors. Therefore, it should not be used to seriously bet on future cryptocoins prices!
